# Typefaces

The letters and numbers on old meters were often hand-lettered or derived from hand-lettered masters, or they were reproduced from typefaces used on engraving machines. As a consequence, there is typically no suitable digital font substitute. In a couple of cases I have created my own font. In other cases, I have drawn the font. Rarely, however, there is a font that reasonably approximates the original.

## Original recreations

**Weston Model 1 Expanded:** Imitates the lettering found on some very early Weston meters, especially the Model 1. Uppercase alphabetic glyphs only with alternate narrower width versions of some glyphs (ETFN). ([Font](WestonModel1-Expanded.ttf), [FontLab source](WestonModel1-Expanded.vfc).)

**Wechselstromskala Regular:** Imitates the lettering found on the German PUM.1 ammeter/voltmeter. ([Font](Wechselstromskala-Regular.ttf), [FontLab source](Wechselstromskala-Regular.vfc).)

**[Gorton Digital](https://github.com/drdnar/GortonDigital):** The [George Gorton Machine Company](http://gorton-machine.org/) produced engraving machines and a house typeface that remains ubiquitous in objects as varied as elevator buttons and restroom signs. Digitization by R. S. Bartgis.

**[Routed Gothic](https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/):** Digitization of a Leroy Lettering set, very similar in history and usage as Gorton. (**[GitHub](https://github.com/dse/routed-gothic)**.)

**[Mil Spec 33558](https://forum.dcs.world/topic/266630-ms33558-font/):** True Type Font designed by Derek Higgs ( 2000) is a digitization of the standard typeface used on virtually all military aircraft instrument panels. The link is to a version modified to correct kerning and allow for use with Fusion360. There does not appear to be an "original" source (website) for this.

## Other commonly used fonts

**Futura** was also widely used in avionics. Clone versions were often used, e.g.: "The proper font is **Spartan**... Mergenthaler Linotypeâ€™s unlicensed version of Futura, copied weight by weight from Bauer. It was produced in 1939" ([source](https://www.key.aero/comment/1923311#comment-1923311)).
