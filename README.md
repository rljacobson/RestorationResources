# Resources for Restoring Vintage Scientific Test Equipment

This repository focuses primarily on digital assets for restoring vintage or antique meters and gauges. In particular, accurate scales for several devices are available.

## [Typefaces](Typefaces.md)

The letters and numbers on old meters were often hand-lettered or derived from hand-lettered masters, or they were reproduced from typefaces used on engraving machines. As a consequence, there is typically no suitable digital font substitute. In a couple of cases I have created my own font. In other cases, I have drawn the letters and numbers manually. Rarely, however, there is a font that reasonably approximates the original.
